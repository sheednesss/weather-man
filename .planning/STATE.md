## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 32 requirements (standard depth)
- [Roadmap]: Mobile deferred to v2 (web-only for v1)
- [Roadmap]: Social features included in v1 scope (Phase 5)
- [01-01]: OpenZeppelin v5.4.0 for latest security patterns
- [01-01]: Custom errors over require strings for gas efficiency
- [01-01]: SafeERC20 + ReentrancyGuard + CEI pattern established
- [01-02]: Factory is oracle for MVP - simplifies resolution flow
- [01-02]: Cost basis reduced by USDC received on sell (capped at current basis)
- [01-02]: Market keeps opposite tokens from splitPosition to enable sells
- [01-03]: Testnet deployment deferred - can be done later when wallet is funded
- [01-03]: SimpleConditionalTokens created as MVP alternative to Gnosis CTF
- [02-01]: Coordinates scaled by 10000 in int32 for precision without floating point
- [02-01]: Resolution flow: factory calls CTF.reportPayouts then market.setResolved
- [02-01]: AlreadyResolved error (renamed from MarketResolved to avoid event conflict)
